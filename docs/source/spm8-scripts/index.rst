Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) comes with a nice user interface, but sometimes small Matlab scripts can help answer your research question. A quick search of the web is usually able to find someone else who has encountered the same problem and written a Matlab script. Here are some useful links for SPM scripting.

 - `Wiki introduction to SPM scripting <http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SPM/Programming_intro>`_ 
 - John Ashburners’ Gems for ( `old versions of SPM <https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/nichols/scripts/spm/johnsgems/>`_ )
 - `Ged Ridgway’s useful scripts <http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/g.ridgway/vbm/>`_ 
 - `Jimmy’s Toolbox <http://www.rotman-baycrest.on.ca/%7Ejimmy/>`_ .
 - `Martin Pyka’s SPM for Programmers web pages <http://spm.martinpyka.de/>`_ elegantly illustratea several SPM functions.
 - `Michael Lombardo <https://sites.google.com/site/mvlombardo/matlab-tutorials>`_ has some very useful SPM scripts.

Toolboxes
-------------------------------------------

 - I have a separate web pages describing my various SPM toolboxes and more complicated scripting pipelines:

 - `MRIcroS <https://www.nitrc.org/plugins/mwiki/index.php/mricros:MainPage>`_ is a simple Matlab program for viewing surface renderings. This can be useful for viewing fMRI activations. The source code is available from `the MRIcroS GitHub repository <https://github.com/bonilhamusclab/MRIcroS>`_ .
 - `Clinical toolbox web page <http://www.nitrc.org/plugins/mwiki/index.php/clinicaltbx:MainPage>`_ for normalizing CT, T1, T2, FLAIR, DW images from clinical populations.
 - My `preprocessing and statistical scripts <http://www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/CRNL/tools/spm-script>`_ provide a analysis pipeline.
 - My `ASL scripts <http://www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/crnl/tools/asl>`_ extend SPM8/ASLtbx features for analyzing arterial spin labeling data.
 - My `Matlab scripts for processing DTI data using FSL <http://www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/CRNL/tools/advanced-dti>`_ .

My own scripts
-------------------------------------------


 - I now host my spmScripts on `GitHub <https://github.com/neurolabusc/spmScripts>`_ .
